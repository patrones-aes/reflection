If you want to use this ORM, you have to create a `connection.properties` file in your resources folder. As it is shown in the following example:

```properties
driver=org.postgresql.Driver
url=jdbc:postgresql://<your host>:<your port>/<your database>
user=<your-username>
password=<your-password>
```
